# FACT2TXT
A small c++ program that takes a txt document with a receipt format and outputs an other txt document with the information re-organized so it can be easily inserted into an excel document.

This is version 1.0 of the program it basicly does what is descibes. It takes both the name of the file that is going to be transformed and the name of the new file that is going to be output.The input file must be in the same location as the program. The output file will be located under the "Archivos_Transformados" folder. Code is still bare-bones and it can be better organized and optimize as will. More feature are planed for future versions like identifing possible errors in the original file and a direct csv file output.
